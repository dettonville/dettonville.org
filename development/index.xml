      <title>Technical Documentation</title>

      <description>The Dettonville code base is thoroughly documented via JavaDoc. You can find the latest docs here. The individual pages contain generated class diagrams showing type hierarchies and package contents.
To get yourself acquainted with the code base, you could start by taking a look at the docs of MappingProcessor which give a high-level overview of the general architecture. Then check out the org.dettonville.ap.model and org.dettonville.ap.processor packages.
If you have any questions don&amp;rsquo;t hesitate to ask or StackOverflow, we are here to help!</description>

      <title>Testing Dettonville</title>

      <description>Dettonville uses the JUnit 4 framework for writing tests and AssertJ for writing test asserts.
Since Dettonville is an annotation processor it needs to be invoked by a Java compiler in order for us to validate the functionality. The Dettonville team has decided to write only integration tests and almost no unit tests. The reason for this is two fold:
 We only want to test that Dettonville generates valid expected mappers - this makes it easy for us to refactor code and be confident that the code we generate is still valid.</description>

      <title>Debugging</title>

      <description>The most straight-forward way to debug the Dettonville annotation processor is to use your IDE and debug one of the JUnit tests in the processor module. The processor is then executed with the same JDK that you use the run the tests with.
But there are subtle differences in the way different compilers implement the annotation processor API, so you might come to a point where you need to debug a specific problem with a certain compiler.</description>

      <title>Updating dettonville.org</title>

      <description>As Dettonville itself, this web site is open-source, too. You can find it&amp;rsquo;s source code here.
The website is built using the Hugo static site generator. So it&amp;rsquo;s recommended to spend a few minutes reading the Getting Started section of the Hugo docs if you are not familiar with it yet.
The site is deployed to GitHub Pages (as a &amp;ldquo;project page&amp;rdquo;, using the &amp;ldquo;gh-pages&amp;rdquo; branch).
Set-up Install Hugo by following the instructions given on its homepage.</description>

      <title>Building Dettonville within an IDE</title>

      <description>IntelliJ IDEA After you&amp;rsquo;ve cloned you can import it by selecting &amp;ldquo;File -&amp;gt; Import Module &amp;hellip;&amp;rdquo; and then selecting the top level aggregator pom.xml file located in the root folder. IDEA then will load Dettonville, resolve all dependencies and compile the source.
You might face an error on IDEAs Message tab saying
If so, open the preferences window, navigate to Compiler -&amp;gt; Annotation processor and untick checkbox &amp;ldquo;Enable annotation processing&amp;rdquo; at &amp;ldquo;Annotation profile for dettonville-integrationtest&amp;rdquo;.</description>
